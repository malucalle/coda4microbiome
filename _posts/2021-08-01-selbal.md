# coda4microbiome and Selbal

**Differences with Selbal**

Both, **coda4microbiome** (Calle and Susin 2022) and **Selbal** (Rivera-Pinto et al. 2018) search for two groups of taxa, A and B, that are jointly associated with the outcome of interest Y. 

The main differences between **coda4microbiome** and **Selbal** are (1) the model for combining the relative abundances of taxa in group A and B, (2) the process for selecting the taxa that will constitute the microbial signature and (3) the type of study that can be approached with each method. 

* Model:
  * **Selbal**: ilr balance between A and B, that is, $B(A,B)=log(g(A)/g(B))$ the log-ratio of the geometric mean abundances of taxa in group A vs taxa in group B
  * **coda4microbiome**: log-contrast, that is, $\sum ùëé_ùëñ  \log‚Å°(ùë•_ùëñ)$ with the constraint $\sum ùëé_ùëñ=0$. Those taxa with a positive coefficient will be in group A, those with a negative coefficient in group B and those with a zero coefficient are not part of the microbial signature.

* Variable selection algorithm:
  * **Selbal**: Forward selection
  * **coda4microbime**: Penalized regression

* Studies:
  * **Selbal**: Cross-sectional studies
  * **coda4microbime**: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies 

In summary, **coda4microbiome** improves **Selbal** by considering a more general model (an ilr balance is a special log-contrast), a more powerful variable selection process (forward selection does not ensure a global optimum) and can be used in both, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.
