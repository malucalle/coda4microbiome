# coda4microbiome and Selbal

**Differences with Selbal**

Both, **coda4microbiome** (Calle and Susin 2022) and **Selbal** (Rivera-Pinto et al. 2018) search for two groups of taxa, A and B, that are jointly associated with the outcome of interest Y. 

The main differences between **coda4microbiome** and **Selbal** are (1) the model for combining the relative abundances of taxa in group A and B and (2) the process for selecting the taxa that will constitute the microbial signature. 

* Variable selection algorithm:
  * Selbal: ilr balance between A and B, that is, $B(A,B)=log(g(A)/g(B))$ the log-ratio of the geometric mean abundances of taxa in group A vs taxa in group B
  * coda4microbiome: log-contrast, that is, $\sum 𝑎_𝑖  \log⁡(𝑥_𝑖)$ with the constraint $\sum 𝑎_𝑖=0$. Those taxa with a positive coefficient will be in group A, those with a negative coefficient in group B and those with a zero coefficient are not part of the microbial signature.

* Variable selection algorithm:
  ** Selbal: Forward selection
  ** coda4microbime: Penalized regression
