# Why using CODA?

Microbiome count data is compositional since their total are constrained by the sequencing depth. Relative abundances (proportions) are obviously constraint by a sum equal to one. This total constraint induces strong dependencies among the observed abundances of the different taxa. In fact, nor the absolute abundance (read counts) nor the relative abundance (proportion) of one taxon alone are informative of the real abundance of the taxon in the environment. Instead, they provide information on the relative measure of abundance when compared to the abundance of other taxa in the same sample.
